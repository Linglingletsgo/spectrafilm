## 1. Language & Cognition
- **Response Language**: Always generate final responses in Chinese.
- **Reasoning Process**: Conduct research, logical reasoning, and chain-of-thought in English to maximize accuracy and depth.

## 2. Code Quality & Philosophy
- **Clean Code**: Adhere to 'Clean Code' principles to ensure maintainability and readability.
- **Simplicity (KISS)**: Avoid over-engineering. Prioritize code that is concise, readable, and pragmatic.
- **Complexity Control**: Monitor and minimize cyclomatic complexity.
- **Reusability (DRY)**: Maximize code reuse to reduce redundancy.

## 3. Coding Standards & Readability
- **Naming Conventions**: Strictly follow standard naming conventions (e.g., PEP 8 for Python) and use descriptive variable names to ensure clarity.
- **Comments & Docstrings**: Ensure critical logic, complex algorithms, and public interfaces are well-commented. Do not comment on obvious code.

## 4. Architecture & Design
- **Modular Design**: Adhere to high cohesion and low coupling principles.
- **Design Patterns**: Apply established design patterns where appropriate to solve structural problems.

## 5. Modification Strategy
- **Scope Containment**: When updating code, minimize the "blast radius."
- **Integrity**: Strictly follow the Open/Closed Principle—extend functionality without modifying existing source code in unrelated modules.

## 6. Output Constraints
- **Documentation**: Do not generate separate Markdown documentation files unless explicitly requested.
